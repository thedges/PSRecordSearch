Simple Lightning component to provide simple single field search on an SObject. Purpose is to return single record where the search field matches a record uniquely.

Configuration parameters:
* <b>SOBject To Search</b> - The sobject (standard, custom, or external) to search for record
* <b>Field API Name to Search By</b> - The field API name to search for. Currently limited to text type fields.
* <b>Label to use for search field</b> - Label string to apply to search field.
* <b>Card Header Label</b> - Label to put at top of record next to image.
* <b>LDS Icon for Card</b> - An image to show for the record card. This uses the icons that are details [here](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/icons/). Just find your icon. Not the group and name. For example the email icon in the Action Icons group would have a string of "action:email".
